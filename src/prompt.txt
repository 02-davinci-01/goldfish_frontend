basically the cards should say username, password, ??
and on flipping over they should say the conent that i have given below

the first would be a hint for the username and it would have this content -- The name with which thou hast been enshrined; the sea creature thou art, of orange hue and gentle grace the second would be for the password and it would have this content -- This creature of the deep speaketh but in twain; two words alone escape its mouth: b**bh*p. the third card would have the content -- "ab itna bhi mushkil nhi h. socho socho -.-"
